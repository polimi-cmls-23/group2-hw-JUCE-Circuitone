Banana Split is a Frequency-Modulated Synthesiser developed with JUCE.
Its main purpose is to generate sounds from a desktop GUI or directly from the Arduino platform that the developers used for the application.
Banana Split is an easy way to generate a frequency modulated oscillator and it gives the possibility to manipulate various parameters, both from the GUI or from the hardware provided along with the arduino platform: 
  - 12 push buttons that simulate a piano keyboard 
  - 6 potentiometers to regulate the envelope and the frequency modulation parameters
  - 4 buttons made out of candies to apply effects on sound.

This is the repository of the original project: https://github.com/jsvaldezv/BananaSplit
